“Let’s create a way for frog’s to shape an AI that talks about AI”

What we’ve done in 1.5 weeks: 

- “slack is a tool we all use everyday, already, to share writing around this topic
	- Prototype a slack bot that looks for articles frog’s send about AI, acting as an interface to create a training data set.

- Research ML options for text generation, landing on RNNs
	-  

Gather articles on articles
Turns out we need a lot of training data, and lots of articles just talk about trends rather than about AI itself.

Test out a few different learning machine learning modules / algorithms on AWS. 
Turns out it’s really slow and generates gibberish because we don’t have enough data

To solve the latter problem, we need to pick a corpus for our AI to learn how to “speak”
	- scientific / academic papers
	- internet arguments 
	- all of english text

After gathering this text, we realize that data is either a) way too broad or b) too many formulae. 

Land on gathering an initial text seed that focuses on canonical prose, striking a cross section between design, technology, and philosophy.

Still need to get over the Partition a machine that currently is running windows, to run ubuntu 16.04
